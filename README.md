## üß∞ Features

- **Antenna Design and Analysis**: Tools for designing and simulating various antenna configurations.
- **RF Component Simulation**: Modules for simulating RF components such as filters, amplifiers, and mixers.
- **Signal Processing Utilities**: Functions for analyzing and processing RF signals.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for visualizing simulation results.
- **SNMP Management**: Integration with SNMP for monitoring and managing networked RF devices.
- **Coverage Planner**: Dual-overlay (dB¬µV/m & dBm) map with ITU-R P.452 loss breakdown, tilt-aware antenna gains and receiver management.
- **Automatic Context Data**: TX municipality/elevation discovery (SRTM + reverse geocoding) and climate snapshots agregated from the last 360 days via Open-Meteo.
- **Professional UX**: Sticky navigation, polished control panel, live spinners and climate/location warnings to highlight pending updates.
- **Azimute Inteligente**: Ajuste fino do rumo da antena com feedback instant√¢neo (linha pontilhada orientada e normaliza√ß√£o autom√°tica 0-359¬∞).
